    Next model is added by Chris Pantazis on 15/Sept/2014.
    It will be used to store a unique key for each household user.
    This key along with the meter id (or something else) will be used
    together for the user to login and change username and password.

    UPDATE: After discussions, we decided to use the SSO for users to login.
    Therefore, the key becomes the password (stored in auth_user, too).
    I decided to keep it this way
    because it is easier for the developer to login as any user for testing
    reasons. Future devs should be aware of this small issue and stop using
    this key as password. Key is being updated when the user changes his/her
    password.

    From this table, only two fields are actually needed. The "sso" field that
    lets us know if the user is stored in SSO database (initially it is false,
    then if user is stored in SSO server by another scheduled process, it
    becomes True. And, secondly, popup which lets us know if the user has
    added extra details we need (if True, it shows a in-between screen that
    asks for name, email and occupants. If form is submitted this value becomes
    False and form is never displayed again).
