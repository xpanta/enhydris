iwidget_ntua
============

This is our first try in creating a modular iWidget installation.
The project is based on Enhydris platform (https://github.com/openmeteo/enhydris/).

Our purpose is to add each widget with its proper name (e.g. uc011, ec031, etc). There should be a README file in each widget app describing what the widget does.
