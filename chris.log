October 2014
============
Added "core" app to be used for core functionality, like singup and other things.



September 2014
==============
Modified utils.py and summary.html to show the correct next target value according to current consumption rate for period. I added get_next_target() in utils.py that calculates
the correct next target. Also I modified get_lpd_arr() for that reason.

Added model "UserValidationKey" in iwidget/models.py for users to signup using meter id and a random generated key

added csv_parser app for parsing csv files

added create_pwds to read csv and create unique passwords (don't know why. I was asked)

It seems there is a problem with the Unit of Measurements. I get this error while importing data.
:::
    Transaction failed while entering data for zone 384 because of error
    IntegrityError('insert or update on table "hcore_timeseries" violates foreign
    key constraint "unit_of_measurement_id_refs_id_22fbc216"\nDETAIL:
    Key (unit_of_measurement_id)=(3) is not present in table "hcore_unitofmeasurement".\n',)
:::

I will create two new entries in the database table hcore_unitofmeasurement
2: Euro
3: KilowattHour

Now I get this:

:::
    Transaction failed while entering data for zone 388 because of error IntegrityError
    ('insert or update on table "hcore_timeseries" violates foreign key constraint
    "variable_id_refs_id_ecccee61"\nDETAIL:  Key (variable_id)=(6)
    is not present in table "hcore_variable".\n',)
:::

I will also have to add rows in table "hcore_variable"

Added these rows in hcore_variable
"1";"Cumulative water consumption"
"2";"Water consumption for a period"
"3";"Cost of Consumption"
"4";"Cold Water Consumption for Period"
"5";"Hot Water Consumption for period"
"6";"Energy consumption for period"
"7";"Cumulative Cold Water consumption"
"8";"Cumulative Hot Water consumption"
"9";"Cumulative Energy Consumption"
"10";"Cost of Energy Consumption"

Added these lines to hcore_unitofmeasurement_variables
"1";1;1
"2";1;2
"3";2;3
"4";1;4
"5";1;5
"6";3;6
"7";1;7
"8";1;8
"9";3;9
"10";2;10

***

Modified Idma.py.
"sum_households = sum_households + 1" added to the right place (check lines 870-890)
because for len(months) < 12 it was giving sum_households = 0
The same applies for the vairavle "sum_occupants" in the same context.



===========
- Added the ability for the user to view hourly and 15 min charts filtered by day.
- Modified iwidget/utils.py for the dashboard to load consumption for yesterday, last week, last month. This happened in method: statistics_on_daily.
    I also added a method (get_lpd_arr)
    that returns a dummy array which length I use to display smiles.
- Modified summary.html and changed the table with a new one displaying consumption of last week, month and yesterday. Added smilies if consumption is good (see above).
    Minor changes to the same file.


***
- Modified base.html to work off-line. Adeel changed it back. But I might revert it in the future. base-cdn.html holds the old file.
- Created App uc_03_1 to host use case's files
- Added necessary methods to uc_03_1/views.py and uc_03_1/lib/common.py
- Created necessary templates at uc_03_1.

Note: In order for my templates to be consistent with current implementation I had to do these things:
    (a) Modified unexe/templates/usecase/c_uc3.2.html. Added lines to load the yearlist to my drop down combo boxes, too. Lines 83-91.
    (b) unexe/urls.py to load my urls.py, too.
    (c) Added uc_03_1 to INSTALLED_APPS in enhydris/settings.py

As I couldn't make Adeel's charts work with my data, I decided to work with jquery.flot instead.
